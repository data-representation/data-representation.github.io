## Assessment information
The module will be assessed through a combination of continuous assessment and a final exam.
The main continuous assessment element will be a project.
This will, by default, be marked out of 50%.

| Type                         | Weight |
| -----------------------------|--------|
| Continuous Assessment        | 50%    |
| End of Semester Examination  | 50%    |

However, a series of optional problem sets will be provided and a full set of solutions to these will be marked out of 20%.
Should the mark achieved by adding this to the project mark scaled to 30% be higher than the mark achieved in the project alone, the higher mark will be given.
Thus, the student can only benefit by completing the problem sets, which should be done as part of the student's study in any case.


## Language
For this module we will be using the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).
No prior knowledge of Go is required.

## Module description

A module in which students will investigate and operate the protocols, standards and architectures used in representing and querying the data that exists across the internet.
Students will also gain practical experience in developing applications that interact with such data.


## Learning outcomes

On completion of this module the learner will be able to:

1. Explain the basic mechanisms by which data is transmitted around the web.
2. Compare the different data models and architectures used in modern web applications.
3. Design and utilise application programming interfaces in the context of the web.
4. Write software applications that adhere to the standards and protocols of the web.
